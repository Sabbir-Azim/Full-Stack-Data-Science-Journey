In Python, self is required in a method because Python automatically passes the instance (object) to the method when it is called. When writing user.login(), Python actually runs it as User.login(user). The self parameter receives this user object, so the method knows which user’s data it should work with. Without self, the method would not know which object is calling it, and it would not be able to access that user’s variables or state.
